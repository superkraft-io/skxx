# Superkraft Module System

The SK Module System is a a NodeJS-like module system

There are a few modules available to use in your soft backend and your frontend views.


## SK Core Modules
The modules in the `sk` folder are modules developed by the Superkraft team with certain specific features.

These modules can me imported/required with or without the `sk:` prefix, e.g `sk:application` or `application`.

| Name       | Description       |        |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| `application`   | API for application information   |
| `vfs`   | Virtual File System module for file manipulation directly to memory rather than disk   |
| `web`   | Perform GET, POST and download files   |


## Node.js Core Modules
The modules in the `node` folder reflect most if not all features of the native NodeJS modules.

These modules can me imported/required with or without the `node:` prefix, e.g `node:fs` or `fs`.

## NPM Modules
The modules in the `npm` folder emulate a few specific NPM modules.

| `fs-extra`   | An extension of the `fs` module   | 🟠 Partial   |


#How to use

You can `require` or `import` any of the available models the same way you would in NodeJS.

For example, if you want to `require` the `fs` module, you simply do the following in any of your frontend code:
```javascript
const fs = require(`fs`)

const data_sync = fs.readFileSync("c:/myFile.txt");

const data_async = await fs.promises.readFile("c:/myFile.txt");
```


##Important to know

- NPM modules are not expected to work, but some may actually work
- Our module system is not a 1:1 implementation of the NodeJS module system, so don't expect it to work perfectly
